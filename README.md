# UTxQuantico
Whenever speed and size matters UTxQuantico or UTxQ gives you an edge in your development cycle. The language provides ultimately high compiling speed with a compiler that is just &lt;1 MB in size. Please read the [README.md Here](UTxQ_old_reusable/README.md)for features and other details.

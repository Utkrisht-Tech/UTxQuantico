# UTxQuantico
Whenever speed and size matters UTxQuantico or UTxQ gives you an edge in your development cycle. The language provides ultimately high compiling speed with a compiler that is just &lt;1 MB in size. Please read the readme file for more cool features.

**(WIP)** :- Indicates Work in progress

- Beginner-Friendly: Anyone can get familiar to UTxQ in less than an hour
- Ultra-Fast Compilation: ~100k loc/s (Target:- ~1.2 million loc/s) 
- Ultra-Light: CPU usage within 3% of C
- Easy dev environment setup: UTxQ can compile itself in less than a second
- Safety: Inherited safety features from Rust and Go
- Supports code reloading during runtime 
- Powerful platform dependent and independent libraries
- Code Translation from various languages (WIP)

# Install Instructions:-
### For Linux Users:-
```
git clone https://github.com/Utkrisht-Tech/UTxQuantico.git
cd UTxQuantico
make
```

**The executable Binary named UTxQ will be build in the repository's build folder**
### For Windows Users:-
Currently Work in progress but can follow above mentioned instructions after installing a unix shell emulator like Cygwin or MinGW.

# (UTxQ) Development:-
If you want to develop UTxQ itself then it is required to have a C compiler (GCC or Clang) installed. For first time compilation and later on the built binary can be used to compile the code written in UTxQ.   

# Contributing:-
Please thoroughly understand the Code Structure of the project explained in [CONTRIBUTING.md](UTxQDocs/CONTRIBUTING.md) before any changes in code otherwise  the code may break and you will no longer be able to use UTxQ to build itself.
## Tasks to be Accomplished:-
   :star: Complete the features marked (WIP) 

# Announcements & Updates:-
:loudspeaker:  **_v0.1 to be released soon._**
